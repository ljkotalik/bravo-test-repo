### Git Process
- Create a repo
- Clone the repo - there is a repo on Github and you need it locally
    - local/locally - your copmputer
    - Remote - cloud, Github, on the internet

-To Make a file - touch 
    -make sure you're inside the repo you just cloned
    -Naming conventions - must be lowercase, no spaces
    -Extension - whatlanguage, what file type
    - .md which stands for markdown

-Added some content
-Added Personal access token authentication
-Local--> remote
    -git status
    -git add .
    -git commit -m "message" (goal of message is to remind myself of what changes I made)
    -git push origin main (not always main)

    ### Useful Terminal Commands
    ```
    ls - lists all the content of the current directory
    touch - makes a new file
    cd <name> - change directory into another nested folder/directory
    cd .. - moves back one level, moves one level closer to the root
